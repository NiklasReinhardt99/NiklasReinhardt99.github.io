I am a third year PHD student at Heidelberg university in the group of Jakob Zech. I studied mathematics and phyics at Heidelberg University and KIT specialising in Numerical Analysis and Cosmology.
My research focuses on developing and analyzing machine learning architectures which act as surrogate models for (infinite-dimensional) maps. I work at the intersection of scientific computing, statistics, and machine learning. In particular, I implement and analyze so-called operator learning architectures in order to solve parameter-dependent partial differential equations.
